            <p>The 2011 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Texas Rangers was an unforgettable 
                showdown filled with resilience and drama. The Rangers, chasing their first title, came within 
                one strike of victory twice in Game 6, only for the Cardinals to rally both times. David Freese 
                was the hero of the night, tying the game in the ninth with a triple and winning it in the 11th 
                with a walk-off home run. That momentum carried the Cardinals into Game 7, where they clinched 
                their 11th championship behind a strong performance from Chris Carpenter and timely hitting. 
                Freese's heroics earned him Series MVP honors, capping a miraculous postseason run for a team 
                that barely made the playoffs. It remains one of the most thrilling and memorable World Series 
                in baseball history.</p>
